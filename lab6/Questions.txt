- It is not in-place: Uses additional memory to store the stack
  frames of the recursivle calls. Each recursive call reduces
  the # of stack frames but it still uses additional memory.

  if stack memory does not count towards extra memory usage,
  then it is in-place.

- It is not stable: The swap does not account for equal keys,
  thus do not preserve order. Ex. 
  4 6 6 6 3 w/ 4 as pivot. Check all, and see that 3 is < 4, so
  swap(x[++M], x[i]) or 6 with 3, thus result is 4 3 6 6 6 and 
  to finish up we swap 4 with 3, getting 3 4 6 6 6. The third 6
  is now the first 6, and thus we have broken the order.

Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Unlikely -> Would require the worst pivot point, either the
  minimum or maximum values. This is highly unlikely as we are 
  randomizing our pivot point.
